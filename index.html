            <h3>PROPERTY RENTAL AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (WEB-DEV PROJECT)</h3>
            <p>I have done a web-dev project in this summer in the program called "IITISOC" conducted by Science and Technology Council group of this college. The name of the problem statement was PROPERTY RENTAL AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. The aim of the project was to create a web platform for users so that the owners can list their properties for rent in our site and the tenants can search for properties and take them for rent. The functionalities present in my project are :</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Authentication based access of the website</li>
                <li>Owners can list their properties for rent by filling the details of them</li>
                <li>An owner portal for owners to see their properties, rented-out properties and the details of the tenants of those rented-out properties</li>
                <li>Tenants can search their wishful properties by using the search filters present in our site</li>
                <li>Tenant portal for tenants to see the properties bought by them and to see the details of the owners of their properties</li>
                <li>Chat-Channel using SOCKET.IO for the communication between owners and tenants</li>
                <li>Easy transaction method for tenants to pay rent through using RAZORPAY API integration</li>
            </ol>
